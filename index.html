	Welcome to my website. I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Yale University. My research focuses on race, 
	identity, and behavior in American politics. <br> <br>
	My dissertation project, "The Politics of Asian-ness: Understanding the Importance of National Origin and Group Membership on the Political Representation"
	focuses on Asian American political behavior and challeneges the examines the conditions and context in which the pan-Asian identity is politically unifying, despite great variation 
	in national origin backgrounds. Through a series of studies, which employ methodologies ranging from experimental design to observational analysis, I find that
	national origin identity is often more important than the pan-ethnic identity, but pan-Asian identity can nonetheless be activated and made salient in political 
	contexts. <br> <br>
	At Yale, I am affiliated with the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and the Center for the Study of American Politics. I graduated from the University of
	  Pennsylvania in 2013 with a BA in Economics, Mathematics, and Theatre Arts, and from University College London (UCL) in 2014 with an MSc Economics. 
	  Before attending Yale, I worked as a research associate for ISPS Health at Yale studying topics related healthcare economics.

	Welcome to my website. I am a Provost's Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://research.upenn.edu/postdocs-and-students/penn-provosts-postdoctoral-fellowships/">University of Pennsylvania</a> for the 2023-2024 academic year. 
	Starting Fall 2024, I will be an Assistant Professor in the Political Science department at <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/">SUNY Binghamton</a>.<br> 
	<br>
	    My research focuses on race, identity, and behavior in American politics. My dissertation project, "The Politics of Asian-ness: Understanding the Importance of National Origin and Group Membership on the Political Representation"
	focuses on Asian American political behavior and examines the conditions and context in which the pan-Asian identity is politically unifying, despite great variation 
	in national origin backgrounds. Through a series of studies, which employ methodologies ranging from experimental design to observational analysis, I find that
	national origin identity is often more important than the pan-ethnic identity, but pan-Asian identity can nonetheless be activated and made salient in political 
	contexts. <br> <br>
	I received my PhD in Political Science from Yale University in 2023, where I was affiliated with the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and the Center for the Study of American Politics. I graduated from the University of
	Pennsylvania in 2013 with a BA in Economics, Mathematics, and Theatre Arts, and from University College London (UCL) in 2014 with an MSc Economics.
